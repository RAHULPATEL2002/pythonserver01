Open Command Prompt:

    Press Win + R, type cmd, and press Enter to open the Command Prompt.

Navigate to the desired directory:

    Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where you want to create your server files.

    bash

    cd path\to\your\directory

Create a Python file:

    Create a new Python file (e.g., server.py) using a text editor like Notepad or a code editor like Visual Studio Code.

    notepad server.py

Edit server.py:

    Open the server.py file and add the following code to create a basic HTTP server.

    python

    import http.server
    import socketserver

    # Set the port number
    PORT = 8000

    # Create a simple handler to serve files
    Handler = http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler

    # Create the server
    with socketserver.TCPServer(("", PORT), Handler) as httpd:
        print("Server started at port", PORT)
        # Start the server
        httpd.serve_forever()

Save and close the file.

Run the server:

    Go back to the Command Prompt, and execute the following command to run your server:

    python server.py

Access the server:

    Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8000. You should see a directory listing of the files in the directory where your server.py file is located.
